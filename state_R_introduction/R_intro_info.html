<p> 
    Before we definitely end the game, <b>you will play for 6 additional rounds</b>. This time, you will be able to <b>give reputation scores to each of the other players</b>, depending on how they played. You will see the results of the last round after you read this page.

<p>
    After investing in the public and private projects, you will see how the other people played. You will then <b>give a score between 0 and 5 to each of the other players</b>. A good score should be given to the players you think deserve a good reputation. The other players will also give you a reputation score. 
    
<p>
    Your goal is now to <b>maximise both your wealth and your reputation</b>. The wealth and reputation score of each player will be shown. When you are ready to play, click on 'Next'.
