<p> 
    While you already played {{C.N_ROUNDS_B}} rounds, <b>the game now continues with a small modification</b>. You will see the results of the last round after you read this page.
    
<p>
    <b>For the next 6 rounds</b>, you will again be able to invest in the public and the private projects, but <b>your investments will be shown to everyone</b>. You will also see how people invested. The way people are investing is therefore completely transparent from the next round onwards.

<p>
    When you are ready to play, click on 'Next'.
