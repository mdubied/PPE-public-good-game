# Game development
The game has been developed using the oTree Studio interface (https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/master/install.html#installation).

# Deployment of the code
To allow for participants to play online, the code needs to be deployed on a server. This can be done directly through the oTree Studio interface by choosing the cloud hosting provider Heroku (https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/master/server/heroku.html)

# Running the code
This code can be run locally by following the information provided in the oTree documentation (https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). Note that this repository was set to store the project rather than to run the project from here. Using oTree Studio is easier to run, adapt, and deploy the code.

# Additional note
At the moment, it is not possible to upload an external oTree project (such as this repo) to oTree Studio. Contact me if you would need access to the oTree Studio project.
